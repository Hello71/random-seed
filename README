random-seed is a random seed management program.  In contrast with other random
seed implementations, random-seed will credit the random seed to the kernel
entropy count.  It attempts to prevent inadvertent random seed sharing by
checking that certain system identifiers, such as the machine ID and filesystem
ID have not changed between a save and load.  If these identifiers do not
match, random-seed will still load the random seed, but will not credit the
entropy.

It is my understanding that other operating systems are either not commonly
imaged (e.g. BSDs) or have official tools for system image preparation (e.g.
sysprep for Windows). Therefore, random-seed is Linux specific. However, it
should be reasonably easy to port by simply adjusting the paths and changing
getrandom to /dev/random.

random-seed requires the following to compile:

- a gcc-compatible compiler (clang is fine)
- GNU make (BSD make is not fine)
- Bourne-like sh (autoconf compatible, i.e. probably all of them)

If compiling from git, autoconf is also required. random-seed does not use
automake, gettext, or libtool.

random-seed requires Linux 3.11 or higher supporting the getrandom(2) system
call.
